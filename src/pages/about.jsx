                  Hey! I'm <strong>Joshua Juma</strong>, a passionate Fullstack Developer specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
                </p>
                <p>
                  With over 3 years of experience, I've built a wide range of responsive, modern, and user-friendly web applications. I love solving real-world problems with technology, creating solutions that are both elegant and efficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also work with Python and PyQt for desktop applications, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring new tools like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript to stay ahead in the tech world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring UI/UX trends, mentoring junior developers, and learning about AI integrations in web development.
                </p>
